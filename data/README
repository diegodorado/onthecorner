* About brain-break-blog project.

'brain-break-blog' project store personal Blogger templates and Makefile which
allow automatic templates uploading/downloading.

Note that Makefile does not restricted by my Blogger account and can work with
any blogs.

Currently project hosted at:

  http://code.google.com/p/brain-break-blog

* How use Makefile.

** What you need to make it work?

 * POSIX utilities
 * GNU Make
 * xsltproc
 * curl
 * tidy

I recommend install Cygwin to obtain these utilities under Windows.

** Getting help from Makefile.

Makefile contain a lot of internal docs. Check it.

Also Makefile support 'help' target (mostly useful is printing of available
targets):

  $ make help
...

** Login to Blogger.

Before any things you must login to blogger service.

To make this create 'Makefile.config' with such content:

  $ cat Makefile.config
GOOGLE_USER = ...       # google account without @gmail.com
GOOGLE_PASSWORD = ...   # your google password

When you put password and before any make invocation
I recommend check Makefile for malicious code ))

Also you can change identity of client (in our case it is Makefile) by setting
CLIENT_ID (may be Blogger service used it for gathering statistics or in
Firewall to stop attacks??):

  $ cat Makefile.config
...
CLIENT_ID = myhome-makefile-1  # in form companyName-applicationName-versionID

Next run:

  $ make login

** First time.

You must store your template in same dir as Makefile in file with proper name.

To create stabs execute:

  $ make create-template-stubs

Above command does not damage any already created templates.

Next you can overwrite templates with remote ones (which stored on Google server):

  $ make overwrite-template

Above command overwrite your template, be careful!

** Download templates.

When you have all '*.blogspot.com.xml' files you can request download template by:

  $ make get-template

After above command in 'web' dir you can found many interesting files.
'*-template.xml' are your templates.

** Upload templates.

After editing templates from '*.blogspot.com.xml' files you can upload templates
to Blogger servers:

  $ make upload-template
